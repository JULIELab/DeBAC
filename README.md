# Background
This project goes back to a workshop on political romanticism in summer 2020 (in planing) which is organized by the graduate school ["Romanticism as a Model"](http://modellromantik.uni-jena.de/) at the Friedrich-Schiller-University of Jena (Germany). It aims to find out whether right-wing populist politicians in the Bundestag (German federal parliament) relate their political arguments to the german romanticism.
