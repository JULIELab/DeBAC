# Background
This project goes back to a workshop on political romanticism in summer 2020 (in planing) which is organized by the graduate school ["Romanticism as a Model"](http://modellromantik.uni-jena.de/) at the Friedrich-Schiller-University of Jena (Germany). It aims to find out whether right-wing populist politicians in the Bundestag (German federal parliament) relate their political arguments to the historical german romanticism.

# Data
DeBAC (/dɪˈbeɪk/, DeutscheBundestagsabgeordnetenCorpus) contains tweets of all members of the Bundestag who have a verified twitter account. Currently, 478 of 709 members of the Bundestag have a verified twitter account. The following table shows the distribution of seats, the number of twitter accounts and the number of tweets of different parties.

|   |Bundestag Members|Twitter Accounts|Tweets|
|---|---:|---:|---:|
|CDU|200|106|173,451|
|CSU|46|24|22,594|
|SPD|152|107|214,934|
|AfD|89|53|83,445|
|FDP|80|69|122,280|
|LINKE|69|56|153,400|
|GRÜNE|67|59|169,450|
|non-party|6|4|16,360|
|**Total**|**709**|**478**|**955,914**|

*italic Due to the limitation of Twitter API ([Get Tweet timelines](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/timelines/api-reference/get-statuses-user_timeline)), we could only get up to 3,200 of a account's most recent Tweets at the beginning of the project (Sept. 2019). Since then, newly posted Tweets are continuously added to DeBAC.
